AI-Driven Emergency Vehicle Priority System Using IoT and Computer Vision

🌐 Overview
In emergencies, every second counts. Traditional traffic systems often delay emergency responders due to static signal cycles.

This project introduces a smart traffic signal management system that leverages Computer Vision, IoT, and Machine Learning to detect emergency vehicles in real-time and dynamically adjust traffic signals — ensuring uninterrupted, swift passage through intersections.

Designed for urban traffic management, this system ensures higher efficiency, faster response times, and safer roads.

💡 Key Features
🚓 Emergency Vehicle Detection using real-time video feed

⚙️ Signal Automation to switch traffic lights dynamically

🌐 IoT Integration for sensor communication and control

🧠 ML Model Training for emergency vehicle classification

🛑 Reduces congestion & manual signal override

🖥️ Web-based interface built using Flask
